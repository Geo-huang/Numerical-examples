These uploaded files contain the data and models used in article “3-D inversion of magnetotelluric data using blockwise-continuous model parameterization on unstructured tetrahedral meshes”.

The *.poly files are the synthetic model files used for discretization by Tetgen. *.ele, *.face, *.neigh, and *.node files are the mesh files used for forward modelling and inversion.
*.data files are the input synthetic or field data files, *.vtk files are the resistivity reults files at the last iteration, *.dat files are the predicted data files.
*.RMS, *.roughness, and *.lambda files respectively record the RMS, model roughness and regularization factor at each inversion iteration.
*.search_times and *.alpha files record the search times and search step length of each L-BFGS iteration, respectively

These data can be used only for academic purpose.
